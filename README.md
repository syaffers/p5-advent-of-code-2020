# Advent of Code 2020 in Perl

Title is self-explanatory, right?

This is a noob's attempt at Perl, feel free to burn it to the ground and let me know what tricks I can use to improve some of the solutions.

## Quickstart

Run each day this way (in Linux systems with Perl installed):

```bash
# Sub `XX` with 0-padded day number and `Y` with day number not 0-padded.
./day-XX/dayY.pl < ./day-XX/input
```

## Day-by-day explanations.

Work in progress. Watch this space.
