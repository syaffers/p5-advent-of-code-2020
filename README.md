# Advent of Code 2020 in Perl

Title is self-explanatory, right?

This is a noob's attempt at Perl, feel free to burn it to the ground and let me know what tricks I can use to improve some of the solutions.

## Quickstart

Run each day this way (in Linux systems with Perl installed):

```bash
# Sub `XX` with 0-padded day number and `Y` with day number not 0-padded.
./day-XX/dayY.pl < ./day-XX/input
```

### About the files

You might see files like `input`, `test`, or `aux`. Here's what they mean:

- `input` are actual inputs that I got from AoC. These are meant to be passed into the Perl scripts as standard in and will produce outputs.
- `test*` are example inputs that will work with the scripts without any modification of the script.
- `aux` (or any other names) are other inputs that will require some changes in the code to run properly. What are those changes? ðŸ™ˆ

## Day-by-day explanations.

Work in progress. Watch this space.
